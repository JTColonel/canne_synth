CANNE: An Autoencoding Neural Network Synthesizer

This repo houses the CANNe GUI, a new music synthesizer based on autoencoding neural networks.
Run player.py to generate and play new sounds.

A sample of the autoencoder's output can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/ann_synth/synthprov 

The synthesizer dataset used to train the neural network can be found here: http://ee.cooper.edu/~colone/
